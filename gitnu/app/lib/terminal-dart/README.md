## A Terminal Emulator that uses the FileSystem APIs

A port of the Terminal example used in the
[Exploring the FileSystem APIs](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/)
article by Eric Bidelman, originally published on HTML5Rocks.

With the FileSystem API, a web app can create, read, navigate, and write to a
sandboxed section of the user's local file system.

This example simulates a UNIX terminal, and replicates common UNIX filesystem
operations such as `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `open`, and `cat` using the FileSystem
API.  To add content, open the app, then drag and drop files from your
desktop onto the terminal window.

You can open the example in Dart Editor and run it by clicking `index.html`.
Or, you can try this
[live demo](http://www.dartlang.org/samples/terminal/).

Please report any [bugs or feature requests](http://dartbug.com/new).
